## GAME PLAY

Down load the latest version of consoleRPG from the release page. Extract the `consoleRPG vX.x-x.x.zip` to the directory. Start up the game and choose `New Game` by pressing `N`, or if you have already have a save file in the directory then choose Load Game by pressing `L`; case of the chosen letter doesn't matter. When you choose `New Game` then choose which race you want to play. When you choose the race you'll be shown the generated stats up to that point, you can choose to re-roll your stats or choose a different race, or go onto choosing the players class. Then when you choose your class you'll be shown your stats up to that point, and when you press `G` you go to town and you can start your game from there. If you want to save your game go to the town and press `5` then press `Y` to save and it will save a `save1.sav` file in the directory that `consoleRPG.exe` is in. You can edit with the `.sav` file with the consoleRPGEditor, which is located [here](http://github.com/thakyZ/consoleRPGEditor).
